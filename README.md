Code for Characterizing functional consequences of reductive protein evolution in Microsporidia

# Description
Code written for my MGY480 thesis project, 'Characterizing functional consequences of reductive protein evolution in Microsporidia'. My code is still in *very* early stages of being organized + reproducible, but I am uploading it for your reference. To see the full file structure of my data + results files, please see my entire code base + files uploaded to X.
